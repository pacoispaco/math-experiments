# Mathematics experiments with Jupytre notebooks

This is my project for experimenting with mathematics and Jupyter notebooks.

I am currently using Python 3.10.

## To get going

Create a virtualenv:
```
$ virtualenv -p python3 env
```

Jump into the virtualenv:
```
$ source env/bin/activate
```

Install requirements:
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Start Jupyter Labs with:
```
$ jupyter-lab
```

## Experiments and Jupyter notebooks

* **the-circle.ipynb**: Some simple stuff with a circle.
